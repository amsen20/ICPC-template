# ICPC-template
Mashti Asli team template. <br>
This repository is forked from my last team [ICPC-template](https://github.com/ar-pa/ICPC-template) that we participated in [ICPC world finals 2020 moscow](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/results). <br>
You can find most of the algorithms that are hard to remember and not so beneficial to memorize but a handful is an ICPC style contest in this repository.

# Usage
You should first simply clone the project and then use the algorithms, most algorithms have either documentation on how to use the code at the beginning of
their file or the main function that uses the algorithms properly.

# Talabarg
In the Talabarg directory, you can find our notes on a variety of algorithms and data structures that can be useful for reminding and reviewing purposes.
